# Hangman Project

### Hangman game is a web project developed in React. This is my first project using Typescript.

## About
This is an implementation of the classic "Hangman" game using React and TypeScript. The game features a gallows, a keyboard, and a randomly chosen word with its letters displayed as '_'. By clicking on a button on the keyboard, or clicking letter on the screen, the corresponding letter is revealed in the word if it exists, or a part of the body appears on the gallows if it doesn't. The game ends when the player makes 6 mistakes.
